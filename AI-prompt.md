help me modify this to be an RCA website (root cause analysis). have text boxes for RCA Name, description timeline, 5 whys.

the 5 whys portion uses a tree structure, but is rendered like a reddit comment thread (collapsible). top level items must be "Whys", all others can be Whys or Root Causes. they can branch.
